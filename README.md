# Blender BakeLab 4.0
This is a fork of Specoolar's Blender-BakeLab2 designed to work with Blender 4.0.

It's also an opportunity to add new features.

Ideas for new features:

- Bake Presets (save and load)
- Clone Bake Object (Will duplicate the selected object, and apply the bakes, maintaining non-destructive workflow)
- Bake to Vertex Color
- Bake Edge Map
